**TITLE**: "Real Estate Insights: Predictive Analytics for Airbnb and Zillow Listings"

 **MOTIVATION**:
 The swiftly changing financial environment, has made it difficult to ensure financial stability as individuals approach retirement. Real estate investment offers a compelling opportunity to supplement traditional retirement plans such as 401(k)s and IRAs. By investing in real estate, individuals can gain immediate rental income and benefit from long-term property appreciation, providing a hedge against inflation. However, the challenge lies in identifying the best markets and properties, and in devising effective pricing strategies. Real estate investment has gained popularity as a strategy for supplemental retirement planning. Platforms like Airbnb allow property owners to tap into short-term rental markets, while the potential for long-term capital gains continues to be an attractive aspect of real estate investment. However, navigating the complex housing market dynamics and making well-informed investment decisions requires specialized knowledge and tools. This project aims to leverage extensive public listing data from sources like Airbnb and Zillow, utilizing advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop predictive analytics models. These models will provide investors—both individuals and real estate professionals—with refined insights into optimal markets, property attributes, and pricing strategies tailored for maximizing returns from both short-term rentals and long-term property investments. The goal is to enhance real estate-centered financial planning and improve retirement readiness, offering investors increased control over their financial futures.

**STEPS**:
Step 1: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website, following the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine by downloading it from python.org. While installing, remember to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" if you are using Windows.

Step 3: Open Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X, and search for "Python." Install the extension provided by Microsoft for enhanced functionality with Python.

Step 4: Download the project or clone the repository in your local environment. Unzip the files if downloaded as a zip file into your respective directory

Step 5: Navigate to the repository ,open a new command prompt terminal, and type 'cd..'
Create a new virtual environment by typing 'python -m venv myenv'. The environment is outside the repository to prevent redundant installations and keep each environment private to individual users.

Step 6: Activate the created environment by passing the command '.\myenv\Scripts\activate' for Windows and 'source myenv/bin/activate' for macOS/Linux.

Step 7: Once the environment is activated navigate to the repository and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the dependencies within the environment

Step 8: Run the command 'python setup.py extract' to get all the data and store within your directory with a folder name 'data'

Step 9: Run 'python eda.py' to get all exploratory data analysis and visualization plots on both airbnb and zillow data.

Step 10: Run 'python preprocess.py' to cleanse, preprocess and store the processed data within the environment. The airbnb data is stored as 'all_airbnb_processed.csv' and zillow data is stored as 'all_zillow_processed.csv' within the 'data' directory.

Step 11: Run 'python model.py' to define all the base and hypertuned models for both airbnb and zillow data 

Step 12: Run 'python train.py' to train all those models with the preprocessed data and save it within the environment.

Step 13: Run 'python test.py' to test the models on both validation and test data sets and evaluate the models based on the evaluation metrics being displayed.
